Spring Boot Microservices Learning Practice
This folder contains a comprehensive collection of practice projects, exercises, and code examples to learn and implement Microservices Architecture using Spring Boot. Each microservice in the folder demonstrates key concepts and facilities necessary to build scalable and efficient microservice-based systems.

Folder Structure
Config Server:

Centralized configuration management for all microservices.
Externalize configuration properties to allow dynamic changes without restarting services.
Service Discovery (Eureka Server):

A registry for microservices to register themselves and discover other services.
Dynamic scaling and fault-tolerance with service instances.
API Gateway (Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway):

Routing and load balancing for incoming requests to the appropriate microservices.
Handles cross-cutting concerns like security, logging, and monitoring.
Authentication and Authorization (JWT, OAuth2):

Implement security using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth2.
Secure microservice communication with token-based authentication.
Load Balancing (Ribbon):

Distribute the load between multiple instances of microservices.
Integrated with Eureka for service discovery-based load balancing.
Circuit Breaker (Hystrix/Resilience4j):

Handle service failures gracefully by implementing fallback mechanisms.
Prevent cascading failures in microservices architecture.
Feign Client:

Declarative HTTP client for communicating with other microservices.
Automatically integrates with Eureka for service discovery.
Service Communication (RestTemplate/WebClient):

Examples of synchronous and asynchronous communication between microservices.
RESTful APIs for interaction between services.
Distributed Tracing (Sleuth and Zipkin):

Track and monitor requests as they flow across multiple microservices.
Collect performance data and troubleshoot issues in distributed environments.
Centralized Logging (ELK Stack):

Aggregate logs from all microservices in a single place for easy access and analysis.
Use ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK Stack) to monitor logs.
Message Broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka):

Implement asynchronous communication between microservices using messaging queues.
Event-driven architecture with pub/sub models for decoupled services.
Database Per Service:

Implement the principle of each microservice having its own database.
Examples of using different databases (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL) with microservices.
Service Registry and Load Balancing (Spring Cloud):

Examples of service registration and client-side load balancing using Spring Cloud Ribbon and Eureka.
Docker and Kubernetes:

Containerize microservices with Docker.
Deploy, scale, and manage microservices in a Kubernetes cluster.
Inter-Service Communication:

Examples of both synchronous (HTTP) and asynchronous (message queues) communication.
Request/response, event-driven, and event streaming models.
Fault Tolerance:

Resilience patterns such as retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, and rate limiters.
Ensure the stability of microservices in the event of failures.
Versioning and API Gateway:

Version control for microservices' APIs.
Manage multiple versions of the same service without downtime.
Key Concepts Covered
Microservices Architecture:

Decoupled services that are independently deployable and scalable.
Clear boundaries with service-specific responsibilities.
Service Discovery:

Eureka-based service registration and discovery.
Microservices can dynamically locate each other without hardcoded URLs.
API Gateway:

A single entry point to route client requests to the appropriate backend microservices.
Load balancing and security handled at the gateway.
Configuration Management:

Centralized configuration using Spring Cloud Config.
Dynamic property reloading without restarting services.
Fault Tolerance and Resilience:

Circuit breakers, retries, and fallback mechanisms using Resilience4j or Hystrix.
Ensure high availability of services even when some components fail.
Inter-Service Communication:

REST API communication using Feign, RestTemplate, and WebClient.
Asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ or Kafka.
Security:

Authentication and authorization using JWT and OAuth2.
Securing microservices endpoints and inter-service communication.
Monitoring and Distributed Tracing:

Use Spring Sleuth and Zipkin for distributed tracing of requests.
Centralized logging with the ELK Stack for monitoring and analysis.
Containerization and Orchestration:

Dockerize microservices and deploy them in isolated containers.
Kubernetes examples for orchestrating microservice deployments.
